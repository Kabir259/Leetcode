gave all my snippets the name qween as its the fastest way to call a template code on a qwerty keyboard

aqween: all queen, biggest snippet. use for codeforces contests
sqween: small queen; cropped(biggest snippet). cleaner. no stupid functions, typedefs and using commands only present.
wqween: no cool abbreviation lmao. use for leetcode if you arent using the Leetcode extension on vscode and it doesnt prepare the question's code for you already.
qween: when you start a question on vscode using Leetcode plugin, it already prepares the queestion's boiler code for you. use this to import header files fast so that vscode autocomplete works and no errors pop up

to use these nevigate to settings icon at the bottom->snippets->new global snippets file (you can do local file if you want the snippet only to be accesible when your working directory is that folder itself)
