1. OFFLINE OA EXPERIENCE
```Q- We have an equation k= (an + bnlog(base2)n + cn^3) , k is achieved by enumeration on this equation. We have to find which value of n satisfy above eqaution. if no such value of n then return 0. (Constraints are for Binary search). input a ,b ,c ,k .logbase2 function is already implemented in IDE. P.S-> Overall easy but tricky -> we have to find optimal search space according to 'c'.```
