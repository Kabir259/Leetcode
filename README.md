# Placement Prep
I'm very retarded and hyperfixated on maintaining clean and organised repos. If you're here for prep, here's what I am doing for 2024 placements prep. IF you want to, you can follow all of this blindly as I've already done the internet scrounging for you and compiled all the best resources you literally don't need to touch anything else UNLESS: 
<br>
a) You want to goon to the endless leetcode lists available on the net
<br>
b) You are autistic
<br>
c) You do Codeforces/Atcoder _(If you want to start this, enroll in AlgoZenith's(better)/TLE Eliminators course) **OR** practice [CP-31](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet), [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) and Div4+3+2+Edu virtual contests to begin with. **Don't** do any other CP ladder like [A2OJ](https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladders.html) or [C2](https://c2-ladders-juol.onrender.com/) before completing CP-31 and CSES._

_I haven't included [sean prasad's list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) and [Neetcode](neetcode.io) as I think if you want to go down that path, striver is better in setting you up with the initial motivation and handicapping you with video solutions while giving you a false sense of security of you being able to do questions. Once you feel you've got a grasp on the basic syntax, start practicing randomly on leetcode by sorting questions and not looking at videos before you understand the solutions/discussions on leetcode_
