# Placement Prep
## ðŸ›‘âœ‹ IMPORTANT
**For Leetcode and Data Structures and Algorithms practice, [this repo is WAYY better than mine](https://github.com/MAZHARMIK/Interview_DS_Algo/tree/master).**  
*I honestly think that this ðŸ‘† combined with [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/) will land you any SDE job lmao.*
  

```(14/10/24)``` The purpose of maintaining the Leetcode section of this repo is no more. Everything except Leetcode solutions (like C, ML, SQL, DBMS, Resume prep etc...) still remain valid. *You may go through my repo, if you want to look at my solutions or listen to my advice, simple as.*

In case I find anything that can be improved upon this, I'll add footnotes here! ðŸ˜¸
1. I think he hasn't covered MCM DP.


## Before you read my 'blog'
I'm very retarded and hyperfixated on maintaining clean and organised repos. If you're here for prep, here's what I am doing for 2024 placements prep. IF you want to, you can follow all of this blindly as I've already done the internet scrounging for you and compiled all the best resources you literally don't need to touch anything else UNLESS: 
<br>

a) You want to goon to the endless leetcode lists available on the net
<br>
b) You are autistic
<br>
c) You do Codeforces/Atcoder 
<br>

First, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoGTHbD2avE).
<br>

Now, if you want to start CP, either pay and enroll in [AlgoZenith's(better)](https://maang.in/)/[TLE Eliminators](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/) courses **OR** practice [HackerEarth Tracks (The tutorials and editorials ðŸ¤ŒðŸ¤ŒðŸ¤Œ *chef's kiss ðŸ’‹*)](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/) > [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) >>> [CP-31 (level-wise)](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet) > [Senior _(Topic wise + A/B/C/D wise good arrangement, but a lot of the solutions videos are **TRASH**)_](https://asksenior.in/learn) ~ [Striver's CP Sheet (Topic wise)](https://takeuforward.org/interview-experience/strivers-cp-sheet) and Div4+3+Edu virtual contests to begin with. _**Don't** do any other CP ladder like [A2OJ](https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladders.html) or [C2](https://c2-ladders-juol.onrender.com/). Whatever I've mentioned is enough._
<br>

I haven't included [Sean Prasad's list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)(*this is utter trash btw*) and [Neetcode](neetcode.io). I you wanna watch videos and code in C++, I think striver is better in setting you up with the initial motivation (*and handicapping you with video solutions while giving you a false sense of security of you being able to do questions*). Choose whatever youtuber you like for the videos. If you can understand hindi, then [Code Concepts with Animesh](https://www.youtube.com/@code_concepts_with_animesh) is what I would reccomend to myself if I could time travel back to my past.  
  

Once you feel you've got a grasp on the basic syntax, start practicing randomly on leetcode by sorting questions and not looking at videos before you understand the solutions/discussions on leetcode, or just do a CP sheet(that would be better if you have time).
<br>

**Make sure to install [Leetcode Fix](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetcode-fix/kgenneohccgagookoocgihpkohmehnip) before solving randomly. You should not attempt the questions with a lot of dislikes w.r.t. likes.**

## Coding
### General
Topic-wise questions from a leetcode list -> basics syntax done -> 
<br>

**First Option(Reccomended)**: Practice leetcode medium+hard randomly in the topic.
<br>

Second Option: Practice interviewbit they have good questions and good sub-categorisation.
<br>

Third Option: Practice on codechef (paying them money is worth it). This will be the closest to what you will get in the OA, a leetcode style interface with CP-like questions. They have an amazing SQL+Python+DS roadmap too which gets unlocked when you buy their subscription & an AI debugger within the code editor.
<br>

Fourth Option: CP list + virtual contests(if you have time).

5. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVwE-4-VatT1Qo9_JJxUdSw (If you want to do leetcode, then this is an equally good _(VERY good)_ alternative to striver. _For prefix sum questions, blindly follow him. I've solved many prefix sum questions using the same method in the Arrays subdirectory._)

### How do I do random prep??? Where do I find similar questions to a topic?????1!1!!11!!!!
Browse down to the ```Similar Questions``` tab under the description of a leetcode question retard. Or just straight up raw dog questions by sorting the entire leetcode problemset with your question's tag and attempting medium and hard.

### Array

2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R0iKZIJwsA&list=PL-dHsQJqbXKnII-6eSmTQlpmpy95mqDOp&index=2 (Kadane's algo)
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0x0E15cieY&list=PLICVjZ3X1AcbaR4HkAjT7IG7f_XaG5Iwn (1D Prefix Sum, use his method everywhere in 1D PS questions. I have solved many using his techinque, check out the array subdirectory. DON'T watch striver for prefix sum PLEASE.) 
4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsyVvdlXLSM&list=PL-dHsQJqbXKlU9imB8OoozyJOm8VWhWx5 (2D Prefix Sum)
5. https://medium.com/@maityamit/prefix-sum-summary-with-practice-questions-sheet-1d-2d-on-leetcode-83c8deb4f713 (Good Prefix Sum questions)

### Binary Search + 2 pointers + Sliding window
1. Don't watch [Aditya Verma's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAdityaVerma/playlists) playlist for this. I don't think you need to see dry runs on paper for such easy topics. DP is exempted from this rule (if you're studying DP for the first time, his playlist is good)
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WE3_HdBRXg&list=PLICVjZ3X1AcYYdde4GTp79zfdp_VACSkX (Watch this, solve his questions and then solve questions from striver's sheet. Don't watch striver's videos for this)
3. Striver for 2-pointers is good. You can watch his videos.

### DP
1. https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1050391/Must-do-Dynamic-programming-Problems-Category-wise

### Graph

### Trees and Graphs

## ML + Data Science
In DS OAs, competittion is close to NULL and prep is EASY. A DS OA will always be centred around python coding ONLY. In python, it will usually be SQL and Numpy+Pandas. Practice this on Stratascratch. An easy(relative to SWE, appx. 800-1200(max) rated questions equivalent to Codeforces) coding round follows with 2-3 questions.
<br>

[StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?code_type=2&is_freemium=1) is the leetcode of Data Science. StrataScratch has videos on youtube that you can refer to while solving or use them as main source of reference (as a sheet per se). 
<br>

[Best Hands-on ML+DS resource ever](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/machine-learning/prerequisites-of-machine-learning/basic-probability-models-and-rules/tutorial/) DO THIS! this is ALL you need!!
<br>

I've made a **list of buzzwords** I encountered during an DS MCQ round in the Data Science/buzzwords.txt. Do look at that. 
<br>

_BTW the pay of a DS is equal to that of a SWE, has equal exit job oppurtunities, puts you in a big company, makes it easy for you to pursue an MBA later, makes it easy to get a core ML role later, the probability and stats you'll learn will help you in countless interviews and unexpected MCQ rounds, you can proudly write SQL and PostgreSQL in your CV, the test has NO competition, the prep intensity difference between SWE and DS is quite literally night and day. **If you're not preparing for it, you either are: an amazing programmer (1600< on Codeforces) or a huuuggeee fucking idiot**_
